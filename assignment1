Assignment One
Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to work with Postman become familiar with HTTP, and REST through the testing 
framework provided by Postman.
You will create a Postman collection and create a REST test within the project. 
You will need to automate each test and include at least 1 assert for each request in the validation.
Requirements
• Sign-up for a free GitHub account: https://github.com/ – Homework assignments will be
stored on GitHub.
• Sign-up for a free WebStorm license (needed for future assignments): https://www. jetbrains.com/webstorm/
– https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
• Create a REST request to get started:
– Create an environment variable book_title for the query string for title
– Url: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={{book_title}}
– Use this request to get a JSON response of books with the name Turing in the title.
– Parse the result and store the id in a postman variable
– Asserts must include
▪ validating books returned have the title turing (e.g. items[i].title)
▪ Response status code (e.g. 200)
• Create a chained request that requests
– Url: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/{{id}}
– Using the id you stored from the first request, make sure the second request uses the
ID pulled from the first request
– Create Asserts that:
▪ Validate response contains the ID from the request
▪ Validate response status code (e.g. 200)
– Review the HTTP Headers in the Request and Response – create text file and describe each key value pair in the HTTP
header in bothrequest and response and check it in with the project to GitHub (e.g. what is the content-type 
and what does it mean)
